# OpenCVExample

This is work in progress to develop a sample extension that depends on the SlicerOpenCV
extension (https://github.com/SBU-BMI/SlicerOpenCV) for 3D Slicer (http://slicer.org).
It shows how to create modules that depend on OpenCV (http://opencv.org/) through
teh SlicerOpenCV extension.

See this Slicer labs page for details on what features will be provided by the
extension, design decisions and such:
